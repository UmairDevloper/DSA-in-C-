# 🚀 DSA in C++ (Algorithm-wise Structured)

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++)** repository!  
This repo is a fully structured, beginner-friendly open-source project for solving DSA problems using **C++**, organized **topic-wise** and **algorithm-wise**.

---

## 🎯 1. Goal

- 🔹 Solve all major DSA problems using C++
- 🔹 Organize questions topic-wise (e.g. Arrays, Linked List, Trees)
- 🔹 Inside each topic, break down by algorithms (e.g. Prefix Sum, Sliding Window)
- 🔹 Build a complete structured roadmap for revision and contributions
- 🔹 Make it open-source so that others can learn and contribute

---



📌 Every topic is organized in its own folder
📌 Every algorithm has its sub-folder with multiple problems
📌 New topics and problems will be added continuously

✨ 3. Features
🔹 Clean folder and file structure

🔹 Easy to navigate and scalable

🔹 Real LeetCode/GFG-style problems with C++ solutions

🔹 Helpful for interviews and coding practice

🔹 Beginner-friendly with logical grouping

🔹 Ready to contribute with minimal setup

🤝 4. Contributions Welcome!
We welcome contributions from all skill levels! If you're learning DSA or C++, this is a perfect place to start. You can:

🔹 Add more problems under existing algorithms

🔹 Create new folders (e.g., Recursion, DP, Greedy, etc.)

🔹 Refactor code or add comments/explanations

🔹 Fix typos, improve formatting, or rename files

🔧 5. How to Contribute
🔹 Fork this repository

🔹 Clone your fork:


git clone https://github.com/UmairDevloper/DSA-in-CPP.git
🔹 Add your changes to the correct folder (e.g., Arrays/Prefix_Sum/)

🔹 Commit and push:


git add .
git commit -m "Added new problem in Prefix Sum"
git push origin main
🔹 Open a Pull Request

🙌 6. Let’s Build This Together!
